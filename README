you compile and run the program: 

rm  cache/* ;reset && make clean && make && ./webproxy <port_number> <cache_timeout>

set your browser to use this port number with all protocols

We can look at the response in the browser using the dev console

How it works:
    First there's two mutexes for cache of files and cache of addresses
    
        if hash_of_file is not in the map of files_cache or past its due
            remove entry from map it's past its due
            
            create new struct for new cache
            access that mutex within the struct and lock it
            
            unlock files_cache_mutex
            
            get response from actual server
            write response to cache
            forward response to client
            update entry in cache map to hold the time of creation for that response
            
            unlock mutex of the new cache
            
        else we have cache
            calculate file hash
            look for the file that holds this hash within the map of caches
            lock that file mutex
            read the buffer
            unlock that file mutex
            send the buffer to client

How link prefetching works:
	For every new response (not from cache) we look for <a href, inside that file, and if there's one, we extract the link and create a new request to download that link. Note: We only prefetch when the contents of that href is from the same website
